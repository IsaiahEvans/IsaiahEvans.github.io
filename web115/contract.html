    <h2>Contract</h2>

    <p>
    I, <a href="introduction.html">Isaiah Evans</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my WEB115 course with my instructor.
    </p>

    <p>
    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>

    <p>
    I understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>

    <p>
    Signed: Isaiah Evans, February 8, 2026
